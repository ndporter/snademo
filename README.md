###Social Network Software for Non-Specialists Demo (December 6, 2013)
###Author: Nathaniel Porter
###Date: December 6, 2013
###Summary: Files related to live demo of SNA software and using network information in regression analysis

=======

###Details
This archive will continue to improve and expand over time. It is meant to help social scientists trained in regression methods to understand how to interface with social network data, how to choose a software package, and how to extract network information to use within regression analysis. It also demonstrates basic network visualization options. I hope it inspires people to try out social networks, whatever their primary tools and methods are. The initial preparation and presentation were sponsored by the Quantitative Social Science Initiative at Penn State University.
